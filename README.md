Leonardo ATR 72MP for FlightGear

The Leonardo ATR 72MP is a twin-engine turboprop aircraft designed for anti-submarine warfare and maritime patrol, produced by the Italian aerospace company Leonardo. Developed to meet the Italian Air Force's need for an aircraft to replace the Breguet Br 1150 Atlantic maritime patrol aircraft, the ATR 72MP (referred to as P-72A within the Italian Air Force) is based on the ATR 72 passenger transport turboprop aircraft.
Although externally the ATR-72MP may appear very similar to the civilian ATR-72, the structural modifications it has undergone are quite significant. Each operator has adapted the onboard instrumentation and equipment to meet their specific needs. All the structural interventions required careful engineering study, resulting in an aircraft suitable for long patrol missions.
